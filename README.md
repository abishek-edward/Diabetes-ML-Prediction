# Diabetes-ML-Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a person has diabetes using the **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset**.  
Built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine if a person is diabetic based on medical attributes.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains features like:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (Target variable)
